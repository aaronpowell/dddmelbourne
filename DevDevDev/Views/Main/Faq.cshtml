            <strong>How much is the event?</strong><br />
            Early Bird $49, GA $59. DDD Sydney is a non profit event and any excess will be kept as part of a fund for future events/donated to charity.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Will refreshments be provided?</strong><br />
            Yes, delegates will receive lunch and snacks throughout the day. Sadly we are restricted from running a coffee cart by the
            university but there are many cafes and coffee shops in the local area &amp; on campus.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Will wireless access be available?</strong><br />
            Probably not.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Can I pay by cheque, invoice, cash, Coinye West?</strong><br />
            No - this year all payments will be via EventBrite. It's vastly easier for us as organisers to only accept payments using EventBrite, which currently doesn't allow payments to be made by Diners or rapper themed bitcoins.
            Please consider using EventBrite with your own credit card, and claiming it back on expenses.
            The cost is low, so it should easily fall within your expenses limit!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Can I cancel/give my ticket to someone else?</strong><br />
            You are welcome to send someone else in your place. Please do this through the Eventbrite system.
            For help on how to do this refer to: <a href="http://help.eventbrite.com/customer/en_us/portal/articles/430100-change-the-info-on-your-order-or-ticket">http://help.eventbrite.com/customer/en_us/portal/articles/430100-change-the-info-on-your-order-or-ticket</a>

            <strong>When does registration open?</strong><br />
            It's open now!

            <strong>What is the hashtag for DDD Sydney?</strong><br />
            The twitter hashtag will be #dddsyd.

            <strong>How long will the sessions be?</strong>
            Sessions will have an hour time slot, feel free to use as much of that as you want. We'll have 3 tracks on the day, and the number of sessions per track will depend on the number of submissions. The more submissions the more sessions we'll be able to run (well, within reason :P).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I want to be involved. Can I help?</strong><br />
            Thanks but we have enough assistance for running the event now. However we would love to have your session submission.
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>I would like to sponsor DDD Sydney</strong><br />
            Great! DDD Sydney will be heavily publized in related websites and we believe
            offers a fantastic marketing opportunity as well as the ability to support the local development
            community. We have various levels of sponsor ship available and opportunities for
            logo placement on the website, agenda, delegate slides, speaker tshirts and we are
            happy to include advertisements in delegate packs. For more information please email
            <a href="mailto:team@dddsydney.com.au">team@dddsydney.com.au</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Who is coordinating this event?</strong><br />
            DDD Sydney is coordinated by SydDev Inc, a non-profit organisation set up to improve the learnings of the Australian developer community.
